## What's it about?
MaxBay is a one of a kind physiotherapy system. We like to think of it as the future of physiotherapy. MaxBay is a complete unit comprising an IoT based sensor and a Windows Game made with Unity. The best part? It's a fully wireless system (the only actual "wires" being the ones supplying power to the microcontroller). This makes the sensor along with the microcontroller a completely independent system, which acts as the controller for the character in the game. 

In other words, our sensor unit is a **wearable controller**.

For a proof of concept, we've adapted our sensor unit for a very specific physiotherapy exercise - _wrist mobility exercise_. We've fitted our sensor onto a glove that allows the patient to easily perform the said exercise. On a very very fundamental level, if you twist your wrist to the left, the game character moves to the left and if you twist your wrist to the right, the game character moves to the right. 

## Sounds good, but is it only for the wrist?
We're not the kind to leave you high and dry, which is why we made sure there's plenty to do with our system. The standalone nature of our device makes it easy for us to integrate it for a wide variety of exercises. You can strap it to your head and accordingly gamify neck exercises. Or let's say for example you've broken your hand (praying that it never comes to that) and you want a simpler way to control your mouse. Well, here's the sensor you were looking for to automate the same.

The possibilities are endless and the only limit is your creativity. Then again, here's a non-exhaustive list from our side, because, well, because we don't like to leave you high and dry.
